# Meeting Insights: Daily - 2026-01-30

## Overview
The team has successfully developed a centralized system in Supabase for managing ventures and services. Deployment workflows have been optimized via Railway shared projects, and a new strategy for continuous community updates is being implemented.

## Key Insights

### 1. Venture & Service Management
- **Centralized CRUD:** System is live in Supabase with full CRUD capabilities for ventures and services.
- **Ventures as Agents:** Ventures are positioned as a "higher-capacity agent class" (companies-as-agents), essential for the future ecosystem.
- **Service Discovery:** Critical focus on registry development and discovery to scale the platform.

### 2. Infrastructure & Deployment
- **Railway Modularization:** Shared services (Gateway, Control API) are now in a shared project to improve stability and resource management.
- **Multi-Workstream Workers:** Workers can now run multiple workstreams concurrently (comma-separated addresses), improving throughput.
- **Quota Management:** Addressed issues with quota hits by implementing delays and better error handling.

### 3. Community & Communication
- **Continuous Updates:** Strategy shift from batch announcements to frequent, automated updates.
- **Automated Summaries:** Plan to use agents to scan commits and generate Telegram/Blog updates.
- **Fireflies Integration:** Plans to link GitHub repos to Fireflies for better data aggregation and transparency.
