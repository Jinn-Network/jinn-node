# jinn-node-railway-deploy

Deploy a `jinn-node` worker to Railway using the standalone `jinn-node` runtime contract.

Use this skill only **after local setup is complete** and `.operate/` exists with a working service.

## When to use

Use this skill when the user asks to:
- deploy a worker to Railway,
- migrate a locally configured operator node to Railway,
- run canary worker validation with a canary `X402_GATEWAY_URL`.

Do not use this skill for local-only setup (`yarn setup`, local worker loops).

## Workflow

Run the deploy script from `jinn-node/`:

```bash
cd jinn-node
bash scripts/deploy-railway.sh --project <name> [--service <name>]
```

Both `--project` and `--service` are "upsert" — links to existing if found, creates if not.

### Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--project <name>` | Railway project name or ID (required unless already linked) |
| `--service <name>` | Service name (default: `jinn-worker`) |
| `--skip-import` | Skip `.operate/.gemini` SSH import (for re-deploys) |
| `--dry-run` | Preview commands without executing |
| `--help` | Show usage |

### Examples

```bash
# First-time deploy
bash scripts/deploy-railway.sh --project jinn-worker

# Deploy with custom service name
bash scripts/deploy-railway.sh --project jinn-shared --service canary-worker

# Re-deploy (credentials already on volume)
bash scripts/deploy-railway.sh --project jinn-worker --skip-import

# Preview
bash scripts/deploy-railway.sh --project jinn-worker --dry-run
```

### What the script does

1. Validates preconditions (`.operate/`, `.env`, Railway CLI >= 4.16.0, auth)
2. Links or creates Railway project + service
3. Creates persistent volume at `/home/jinn`
4. Reads `.env` and pushes all non-empty variables to Railway (batched, `--skip-deploys`)
5. First-time only: deploys idle container (`tail -f /dev/null`), imports `.operate/` and `.gemini/` via SSH, then restores real start command
6. Deploys the worker
7. Verifies deployment and shows recent logs

### Canary validation

For canary rollout:
1. Set `X402_GATEWAY_URL` to canary gateway and `WORKSTREAM_FILTER` to canary workstream in `.env`
2. Deploy with the script
3. Validate tool/business success
4. Promote: update `.env` with prod gateway URL, re-deploy with `--skip-import`

## Runtime contract reminders

- Railway deployment is `.operate`-first (`/home/jinn/.operate`).
- `JINN_SERVICE_MECH_ADDRESS` and `JINN_SERVICE_SAFE_ADDRESS` are fallback overrides, not primary operator flow.
- Use `jinn-node/railway.toml` (standalone), not monorepo deploy configs.
- **Healthcheck port:** Railway auto-sets `PORT`. The worker reads `HEALTHCHECK_PORT` > `PORT` > `8080`. Do not set `PORT` manually.
- **Do NOT use `railway logs -f`** — in CLI 4.16+, `-f` is `--filter`, not "follow". Use `railway logs --lines N`.

## Failure handling

If deployment fails:

1. List deployments and identify the failed one:
   ```bash
   railway deployment list
   ```

2. Capture deployment-specific logs:
   ```bash
   railway logs --lines 300 <failed-deployment-id>
   ```

3. Confirm volume exists and is attached:
   ```bash
   railway volume list
   ```

4. Confirm `/home/jinn/.operate` and `/home/jinn/.gemini` are present:
   ```bash
   railway ssh -- 'ls -la /home/jinn/.operate /home/jinn/.gemini'
   ```

5. Verify `OPERATE_PASSWORD` matches local keystore.

6. Verify endpoint URLs and gateway mode (canary vs prod).
